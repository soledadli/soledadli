### Hi there 🍎 I am Soledad, a good friend with Mrs. Hedgehog. 


- 🔭 I’m currently studying Digital Sciences at Université de Paris. 
- 🌱 I hold a bachelor degree in Humanities with a focus on inclusive theater at Bard College Berlin. 
- 🙋 I’m looking for an internship in data analysis or project management. 
- 🍰 I’m looking for companions to study coding and data science together. I can tell you lots of peculiar stories during the break.
